# H1N1_Vaccine_Prediction_Logistic_Regression

Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune responses 
and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems vaccinology can 
combine omics data and machine learning techniques to obtain highly predictive 
signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Currently, several machine 
learning methods are already available to researchers with no background in 
bioinformatics.

The objective of this project is to Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic 
Regression.

Scope:
● Exploratory data analysis
● Data Pre-processing
● Training logistic regression model with MLE and SGD for prediction
